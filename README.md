# TCP_Hijacking_Attack_using_Python

The code serves to conduct a TCP Hijacking Attack (type of Man in the Middle Attack) and create an unwanted directory in another machines bin file by masking the original identity of the attacker. The scenario consists of three machines, Machines 1,2 and 3. Machine 1 pretends to be Machine 2 by associating its IP address with its very own MAC address thereby making Machine 3 think that Machine 1 is actually Machine 2.
